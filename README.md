# Go Code Generation for Isabelle

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/697269869.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/697269869)

This repository contains a standalone Code Generation Target for the Go
programming language for use with Isabelle2023.

To use it, simply import the `Go` session defined herein into your own development,
and import the `Go_Setup` theory. Code can then be exported in the usual way with

~~~isabelle
export_code <name> in Go
~~~

which produces code that can be used from Go.

## Trying it out

This repository contains a test session `Go_Test`. If you have Isabelle2023
installed, just run the following command:

~~~shell
isabelle build -v -e -D .
~~~

This will build the `Go_Test` session and export some sample code to
`go_test/export`. If run for the first time, this may take quite a
while to complete (half an hour on a slow machine).

To test the generated code, run the following commands:

~~~shell
cd go_test/go
go test -v ./Interface
~~~

This should produce some (successful) test output, indicated with `PASS`.

The `go_test/go` folder contains some hand-written wrapper code that references
the generated code in `go_test/export`. Note that the above invocation of
`go test` will fail if the generated code is not present.

The purpose of the hand-written code is to demonstrate that the generated code
does indeed run as expected.

## Using Docker/Podman

If you do not want to install Isabelle or Go, you can also run the test
session.

Build and run the Docker image as follows:

~~~shell
docker build -t isabelle_go_test .
docker run -it --rm isabelle_go_test
~~~

If you supply a different entry point when starting the container (e.g.
`/bin/bash`), you can also play with the Go target interactively.

Again, the `docker build` may take quite a while, but `docker run`
should complete within a few minutes.

In the container, the code will be generated into the folder
`/home/isabelle/go-code-gen/go_test/export`. By using the following Docker
commands, you can inspect the generated files:

~~~shell
docker run -it --name=generated_go isabelle_go_test
docker cp generated_go:/home/isabelle/go-code-gen/go_test/export <local_directory>
~~~

This instructs Docker not to delete the temporary container, and then uses
`docker cp` to extract the generated code.
